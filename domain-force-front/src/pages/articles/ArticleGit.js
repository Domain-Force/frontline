		<p className="article-body">
			git, is a software that helps you keep track of the version history of your code base. tracking who changed what code, added code, removed code, etc., and itâ€™s incredibly useful to be able to collaborate with your sweaty palmed friends.
		</p>


		<div className="article-section">disclaimer</div>
		<p className="article-body">
			i canâ€™t teach you everything about git and all the git commands but i can give you a semi-decent overview of what itâ€™s used for and the most used commands i use when building/updating domain-force

			<p className="article-section">what's git? (sorry long analogy)</p>
		</div>

		<p className="article-body">
			i realize some of us are complete noobs and may need some way to conceptualize this as i explain it, donâ€™t worry i had trouble too. letâ€™s imagine youâ€™re working on a book with a friend, and both of you want to work simultaneously without getting in each other's way. 
		</p>
		<p className="article-body">
			you guys decide to work on different chapters, and in git this would be different â€˜branchesâ€™. letâ€™s also say youâ€™re writing this on paper, so every time you have to write something itâ€™s known as a â€˜commitâ€™.
		</p>
		<p className="article-body">
			the trash can in the corner of your room with all the pieces of paper full of your previous revisions that you scrapped, re-written, added, or removed; thatâ€™s the commit history. this is how youâ€™re able to look back at what was done before so you can realize how you got to where you are now.
		</p>
		<p className="article-body">
			when you and your friend decide to put the chapters youâ€™ve finished together on a table, you can think of this as a â€˜pull requestâ€™. weâ€™re requesting that our editor reviews what weâ€™ve written and gives us feedback, in git this is the equivalent of a code review. 
		</p>
		<p className="article-body">
			now after your chapter has been vetted, the editor will add it to the final revision, the book. this is known as the â€˜mainâ€™ branch, â€˜productionâ€™ branch, and formerly it was also known as â€˜masterâ€™ branch.
		</p>
		<p className="article-body">
			rinse and repeat, until all the chapters are done and BOOM. youâ€™ve finished writing your book, or in real life you would have finished your first iteration of the project. this whole project can stored online as a <button className="button-like-text" onClick={() => openModal('repository')}>respository/repo</button>.

			<p className="article-section">what's github?</p>
		</div>
		<p className="article-body">
			github, is a website that stores git repositories for MILLIONS of people. going with our analogy from the last section, you can think of it as a library of books!
		</p>
		<p className="article-body">
			github gives everyone a place to go to, if they wanted to download your code, review your code, submit a report if a bug was found, etc.

			there are tons of reasons why we use git, some of the reasons were mentioned previously; collaboration, code review, and issue tracking. iâ€™m not going to go in-depth on the following but you should at least be familiar with some of the reasons:
